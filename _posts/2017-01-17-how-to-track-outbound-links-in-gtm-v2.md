A great how-to for those looking to set up Outgoing link tracking in their Google Tag manager account.  

> This tutorial assumes you already have a Google Tag Manager account, have created a Container, and have installed it in your website (if not, start with the Tag Manager Help). You should also already have a Google Analytics account for your website, and have already installed the tracking code with one of the methods recommended by Google Analytics. Start by opening up Google Tag Manager and clicking on your Container to begin.
